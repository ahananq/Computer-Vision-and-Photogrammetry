# Computer-Vision-and-Photogrammetry
### Course at University of Wroclaw - full 3D reconstruction from images pipeline

Project implemented totally in Python with use of NumPy and SciPy.

Tasks are grouped in separate labs:
* **Lab1** - Computing projection matrix from 2D and 3D points correspondence
* **Lab2** - Estimating lens distortion and images undistorting
* **Lab3** - Epipolar geometry, fundamental and essential matrices, triangulation
* **Lab4** - Features detection
* **Lab5** - Features descriptors
* **Lab6** - Full reconstruction from images to 3D-point cloud

Results of every lab can be found in corresponding directory.
